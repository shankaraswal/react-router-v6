          Before you begin, I would recommend that you start out by downloading
          an HTML & CSS IDE. My personal preference is to use an IDE by
          JetBrains. You can download the PyCharm Community Edition for free,
          which has really good HTML, CSS and JavaScript development support
          built-in, along with all the goodies that a good IDE provides - source
          code integration, code refactoring, automatic indentation, syntax
          highlighting, comparison tool, etc.

          You may also copy and paste this code into a new file in your text
          editor or IDE, and save the file as "index.html". The "index.html"
          file is the default file that a web server will look for when
          accessing a website. After saving the file, you can double click it to
          open it with your browser.
